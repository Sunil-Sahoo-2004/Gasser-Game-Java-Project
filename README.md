# Gasser Game

## Project Overview
Gasser is a fun and interactive game built using Java. The objective of the game is to guess the correct number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## Features
- Random number generation for each game session.
- Feedback on guesses (higher or lower).
- User-friendly console-based interface.
- Ability to restart the game after each session.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language used for building the game.
- **Random Class**: For generating random numbers within the guessing range.
- **Scanner Class**: For capturing user input.

## How to Play
1. The game randomly generates a number within a given range (e.g., 1-100).
2. The player enters their guess.
3. The game responds with:
   - **Too high** if the guessed number is higher than the target number.
   - **Too low** if the guessed number is lower than the target number.
   - **Correct** if the guessed number matches the target number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
5. After the game ends, the player can choose to play again or exit.

## Setup and Installation
To run the Gasser game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
